    "Training error and generalization error generally differ: since the objective function of the optimization algorithm is usually a loss function based on the training dataset, the goal of optimization is to reduce the training error. However, the goal of deep learning (or more broadly, statistical inference) is to reduce the generalization error. To accomplish the latter we need to pay attention to overfitting in addition to using the optimization algorithm to reduce the training error."
