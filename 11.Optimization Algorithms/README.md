## 11.Optimization Algorithms

They were the tools that allowed us to continue updating model parameters and to minimize the value of the loss function, as evaluted on the training set. Indeed, anyone content with treating optimization as a black box device to minimize objective functionin a simple setting might well content oneself with the knolwdge that there exists an array of incantations of the sych a procdure.

The performance of the optimization of the algorithm directly affect the model's traning effiency.
