# Dive-Into-Deep-Learning

Deep learning all about the optimization. We have a model with some parameters and we want to find those that fit our data the best.
Determing which way to move each parameter at each step o an algorithm requies a little bi calculus , which will be briefly introudced.

autograd package automatically computes differentiatin for us , and we will cover it next.
